## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python

**Libraries used:** pyAutoGUI, aiosmtplib

## Why was it made?
My friend talked to me about a recurring issue with being unable to accept his League of Legends matches because he sometimes has to leave his computer for a moment. To address this issue, my program was created to automatically accept your matches. This guarantees that your matches are accepted and you avoid penalties, even during those unavoidable breaks.

## Lessons Learned:
This was a short project, but one that was so incredibly useful to me and my friends. Developing this program has made me realize how satisfying it is to code and fix real issues that people have. My friend came to me with an issue, and using my coding knowledge and skills, I was able to fix it.
